# TRICAM
Pedestrian detection is an important task in both the automotive and robotics fields for autonomous driving. Most of the common publicly available datasets are not designed for multimodality to the same extent. The need for reliable data in various forms for multimodal spiking neural networks in an egomotion setting is clear, and a dataset to address this need was long overdue. This is why the triCam dataset integrates RGB, depth, Real events, and an IMU sensor.
